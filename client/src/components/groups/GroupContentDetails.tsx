        CryptoPunks are a series of 10,000 unique 8-bit style digital characters
        created by software developers Matt Hall and John Watkinson, also known
        as Larva Labs. They were released in 2017 as one of the first
        non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each CryptoPunk has its own distinct traits, such as hairstyles,
        clothing, and accessories, and is completely unique. Some of the rarest
        CryptoPunks have sold for millions of dollars in online auctions.
        <br />
        <br />
        CryptoPunks are considered to be one of the earliest examples of the NFT
        boom that has taken place in recent years, and they have become a symbol
        of the potential of blockchain technology to enable the creation and
        ownership of unique digital assets.
        <br />
        <br />
        Today, CryptoPunks are highly sought-after by collectors and investors
        in the NFT space, and their popularity has led to the creation of many
        other NFT projects that aim to replicate their success.
